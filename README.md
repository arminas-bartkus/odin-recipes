# odin-recipes

**THIS PROJECT IS ODIN PROJECT TRAINING
EXERCISE**

1st Project from the Odin Project.

In this project I will be producing a 
recipes website using solely html.

The main funcitionality will be to navigate 
between different recipes(using links), viewing 
images, and instructions for each individual recipe.

The main skills portrayed here include:

- html boilerplate set up
- adding absolute and relative links 
(both images and pages)
- using elements such as strong/em/
 as well as element atributes such 
 as src and hypertext reference (href)
- Including both ordered and 
unordered lists
